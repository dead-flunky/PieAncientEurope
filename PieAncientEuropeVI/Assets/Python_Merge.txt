this is a personal log of the changes from pie AE AFTER KMOD merge
written and merged by Keldath for Pie and his community with love


edit:
i got some python errors, probabaly i miss merged some files, so i made a new one without all the below 
except the ones i marked with **
ill continue the merge part by part to some extent.
most of the py was changed by Pie, he needs to figure out what he wants to take from kmod.
on top of the additons , karadoc / f1rpo added code to work with the dll i would add those.
besides the bug.
if any - i recommend start off from scratch the pie py on this kmod ptrhon mod all together.
